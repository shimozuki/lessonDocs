Why Learn JavaScript? To start my career.

Javascript is the only language that lets you do every aspect of technology.

This lesson will cover the fundamental building blocks of coding:

- Variables
- primitive data types
- truthy and falsey properties
- functions


VARIABLES
The act of storing information
Storing data into a variable


BEST PRACTICE
Good practice means practicing good habits to become a good software engineer.

const stands for constant variable.
let declares a varibles that may change

Rule of Thumb:
use const until you can't anymore. 


PRIMITIVE DATA
Variables can store all types of data.

-Numbers
-Strings
-Booleans

NUMBER 
Lets you work with numbers that can be manipulated using operators.
(additions, subtractions, multiplication or division, modulus)

+ - add
- - sub
* - multi
/ - divide
% - modulo (divide remainder)


STRINGS

A string can be words, sentences, or a bumch of characters.
You must terminate the string with the same symbol.

TEMPLATE LITERALS (TEMPLATE STRINGS)
Allows us to put the variables directly into the string:

BOOLEAN
Can be either true or false

comparison operators like:
===
!==
> <
give a boolean values of true or false


TRUTHY / FALSEY

Every data is either truthy or falsey

Falsey: There are only six falsey values
- false
- 0
- ""
- undefined
- null
- NaN

Truthy: everything else

Not operator: !
looks at the value's truthy/falsey property and then 
returns the opposite boolean.


And operator: &&
Evaluates the left and right side's truthy and falsey values
- If the left side is falsey, return that value.
- If the left side is truthy, return the value on the right side.


Or operator: ||
Evaluates the left and right side's truthy and falsey values
- If both sides are truthy, return the left value
- If one value is truthy, return that value 
- If both sides are false, return the right side


CONDITIONAL IF STATEMENT
If something is truthy, execute that block of code


ELSE STATEMENT
If something is falsey, don't execute that block.
Check the else statement


FUNCTIONS
- Instructions for the computer to follow
- If you don't return anything the computer returns false
- Run a function by adding ()

Arrow functions are the most important concept in JavaScript.


PARAMETERS / ARGUMENTS
- When you run a function, the data you pass in are
called arguments.
- Parameters must have variables names.


FUNCTIONS WITH CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOR
-  The code inside the curly brackets will execute if the value
inside the parantheses is truthy.


EXECUTION CONTEXT
Before the computer runs code, it first creates a 
box to stores all the variables.
