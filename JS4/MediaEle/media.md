AUDIO

<audio src="https://songz.c0d3.com/js4/examples/0415.mp3" class="aud" controls></audio>

- the src attribute tells the browser where to get the audio file
- the controls attribute tells the browser to display the audio controls 

The audio tag has a seperate closing tag because it's possible to give it children elements.

Audio elements have helper functions such as play() and pause().
