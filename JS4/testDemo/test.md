Testing your code is so important, it has become common to practice Test Driven Development (TDD).

TDD is the concept of writing all your tests first and then writing your code.

Writing with tests in mind helps you write code faster, more efficiently, and more cleanly by giving you a clear target of what you're developing towards.

Testing framework
- runner: runs the tests
- library: gives you helper functions (expect, it, describe)
- reporter: displays results
