Event Listeners

It is best practice to add event listeners:
addEventListener('eventName', function)

mouseenter
- This event fires when the moust first moves onto the element

mouseleave

keyup
- fires every time the user releases a key.

mousemove

When the browser runs your function for these events,
it will pass in an object as an argument.

This object will contain properties such as the mouse position
or the key that was pressed
