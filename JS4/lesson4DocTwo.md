TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)

Testing code is important, 
so it's common practice Test Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is the concept of writing all your tests first and 
then writing your code.

Writing with tests in mind helps write code:
- faster
- more efficeintly
- more cleanly by giving you a clear target of what you're developing towards.

It can be easier to write a more complete set of tests before 
you've started coding, because your mind is still focused on 
what the program should do, not what it can do.
