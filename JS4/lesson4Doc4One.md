TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Because testing your code is so important, it has become common to practice Test Driven Development.

TDD is the concept of writing all your tests first and then writing your code.

writing with tests in mind helps you write code faster, more efficiently, and more cleanly by giving you a clear target of what you're developing towards.

Additionally, it can be easier to write a more complete set of tests before you start coding.

---Components of a testing framework---

- runner to run the tests
- library to give helper functions
- reporter that displays results, like which tests passed or failed

TDD is a process where you write the test first, then write the function.
TDD is very common among developers.

It's best practice to have each function you wnat to test contained in its own code block.
