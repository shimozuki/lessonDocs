CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
<script></script> tags tell the browser to run everything inside
that tag as javascript.

This enables developers to build interactive and useful apps
(todo list, stopwatch, meme generator and more)

There is another tag to make websites pretty

<style></style> tags tell the browser to run everything inside
that tag as CSS.

CSS helps change HTML element's color, position and other
properties of browser elements.

CSS is a really simple language. You only need to know 3 things.

Selector: h1
Property: color
Values: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1);

h1 {
  color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1);
}

1. Selector: 
All elements that match your selector will have the properties
{} inside the {} applied to them.

2. Properties:
Each property is seperated by ;

3. Values:
Values are going to be different depending on what 
properties you use.

For colors, you can use rgba function.
rgba stands for red, green, blue and alpha (opacity)
